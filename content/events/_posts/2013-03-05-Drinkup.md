We have two presentations on the agenda:

  Adina will present an overview of the messaging systems spectrum and
  the key questions to ask to make the right choice for your own application.

* *Do Repeat Yourself! Self-reproducing programs* by [Jean-Baptiste Mazon](http://twitter.com/jbmazon).

  We will play with _quines_, computer programs which produce a copy of their source code.

Join us to chat over a drink and meet with the Ruby community of Sophia.
