title: Ruby Drink-up / December 2012
---

The next Ruby Drink-up of Sophia is to take place on
__Tuesday__, the __4rd of December__ at __6:30pm__ at the __Green King__ pub, 
[espace Saint-Philippe](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=43.618463&lon=7.0753385&zoom=18&layers=M&mlat=43.61858&mlon=7.07508),
Sophia Antipolis.

2 things on the agenda:

* [Muriel Salvan](http://twitter.com/MurielSalvan) will present us [rails-ajax](http://rails-ajax.sourceforge.net): a gem that automatically ajaxifies your Rails application!
* A discussion around the future of our Ruby drink-ups: we will discuss many opportunities to make those drink-ups evolve. Have new ideas? a different vision? Come talk about it around a beer.

Join us to chat over a drink and meet with the Ruby community of Sophia.
