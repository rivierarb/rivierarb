Sophia Antipolis.

We have a great presentation on the agenda:

* *Idris and Dependent Type Programming*, presented by Anwar Rizal [@anrizal](https://twitter.com/anrizal).

  We are going to have a look at [Idris](http://www.idris-lang.org/), a general purpose programming language that supports dependent type.
  First, we look into what dependent type is, why it is interesting, dependent type in Idris, and a demo of Idris programming.

Join us to chat over a drink and meet with the Ruby community of Sophia-Antipolis!
