title: Ruby Drink-up / January 2013
---

The first Ruby Drink-up of 2013 is to take place on
__Tuesday__, the __8th of January__ at __6:30pm__ at the __Green King__ pub, 
[espace Saint-Philippe](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=43.618463&lon=7.0753385&zoom=18&layers=M&mlat=43.61858&mlon=7.07508),
Sophia Antipolis.

We have two presentations on the agenda:

* *The Ruby object model* by [Nicolas Bondoux](http://twitter.com/nicolas_bondoux).
  We will learn how Ruby implementations deal with various object-oriented concepts
  like classes, mixins, objects and inheritance.
* *What's up with Ruby at Twitter?* Karan Malkani will tell us the
  story of Ruby at Twitter and what it means to run the "slowest
  programming language" at that scale.

Join us to chat over a drink and meet with the Ruby community of Sophia.
