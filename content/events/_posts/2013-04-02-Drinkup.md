The next Ruby Drink-up of Sophia is to take place on
__Tuesday__, the __2nd of April__ at __6:30pm__ at the __Green King__ pub, 
[espace Saint-Philippe](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=43.618463&lon=7.0753385&zoom=18&layers=M&mlat=43.61858&mlon=7.07508),
Sophia Antipolis.

We have two presentations on the agenda:

* *How to make the right choice for your messaging system?* by [Adina Mihailescu](http://twitter.com/acm1107).

  Adina will present an overview of the messaging systems spectrum and
  the key questions to ask to make the right choice for your own application.

* *A Rails toolbox for Ember* by [Emmanuel Bastien](http://twitter.com/ebastien).

  We will present a selection of tools to make client-side development
  with [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) really smooth on top of a
  [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) server stack.

Join us to chat over a drink and meet with the Ruby community of Sophia.
