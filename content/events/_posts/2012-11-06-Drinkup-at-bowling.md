title: Ruby Drink-up / November 2012
---

The November Ruby drink-up is to take place on
__Tuesday__, the __6nd of November__ at __6:30pm__ at the __Antibes' Bowling' pub__ called Warm'Up, 
[here](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=43.60028&lon=7.09188&zoom=18&layers=M&mlat=43.60028&mlon=7.09188),
Antibes.

We decided to change the usual place for the first time: let's try something new.
We still have beers during the meetup, and then restaurant and bowling can be ours!

During this drink-up, [Jean-Baptiste Mazon](http://twitter.com/jbmazon) will organize a battle: Lambda Calculus VS Turing Machines!

Don't miss this opportunity to learn new things, chat over a drink and meet with the Ruby community of Sophia!
