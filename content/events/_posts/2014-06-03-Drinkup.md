---

Our next Ruby Drink-up in Sophia-Antipolis is to take place on
__Tuesday__, the __3rd of June__ at __6:30pm__ at the __Green King__ pub,
[espace Saint-Philippe](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=43.618463&lon=7.0753385&zoom=18&layers=M&mlat=43.61858&mlon=7.07508),
Sophia Antipolis.

We are delighted to welcome [Jean-Baptiste Mazon](http://twitter.com/jbmazon) as our speaker for
this meetup.

You should definitly join us.

The fact that we have [no idea what he is going to talk about](http://www.slideshare.net/jbmazon/untitled-talk) can only
make this event even more attractive.

All of us remember the wonderful talks crafted by [Jean-Baptiste](http://twitter.com/jbmazon):

* *[The Dark Side of Programming Languages](http://www.slideshare.net/jbmazon/the-dark-side-of-programming-languages)*
* *[Typesafe web programming with Haskell and Yesod](https://github.com/jmazon/yesod-blog-live-demo/wiki)*
* *Lambda Calculus VS Turing Machines*
* *[Do Repeat Yourself! Self-reproducing programs](http://www.slideshare.net/jbmazon/quines-38575502)*

Join us to chat over a drink and meet with the Ruby community of Sophia-Antipolis!
