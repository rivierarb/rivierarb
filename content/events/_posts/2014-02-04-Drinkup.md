---

The next Ruby Drink-up of Sophia is to take place on
__Tuesday__, the __04th of February__ at __6:30pm__ at the __Green King__ pub,
[espace Saint-Philippe](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=43.618463&lon=7.0753385&zoom=18&layers=M&mlat=43.61858&mlon=7.07508),
Sophia Antipolis.

We have 2 presentations on the agenda:

* *Parsing Expression Grammars with [Treetop](http://treetop.rubyforge.org/)* by [Emmanuel Bastien](http://twitter.com/ebastien).

  Emmanuel will talk about how Ruby can be very handy in defining and parsing grammars using the Treetop gem.

* *Using [Docker](https://www.docker.io/) for your Rails and Ruby projects* by [Muriel Salvan](http://muriel.x-aeon.com).

  Have you heard about Docker? After a quick presentation, Muriel will show how Rails and Ruby projects can be used inside Docker containers.

Join us to chat over a drink and meet with the Ruby community of Sophia-Antipolis!
