---

The next Ruby Drink-up of Sophia is to take place on
__Tuesday__, the __5th of February__ at __6:30pm__ at the __Green King__ pub, 
[espace Saint-Philippe](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=43.618463&lon=7.0753385&zoom=18&layers=M&mlat=43.61858&mlon=7.07508),
Sophia Antipolis.

We have two presentations on the agenda:

* *[Rubinius](http://rubini.us/)* by [Emmanuel Bastien](http://twitter.com/ebastien).
  We will learn about the Ruby implementation of Ruby and
  how it compares with other implementations of the language.
* *[Ruby 2.0](http://bugs.ruby-lang.org/versions/6)* by [Philippe Antras](http://twitter.com/_philant_).
  Philippe will tell us about the latest major revision of the Ruby language,
  expected to be released on the 24th of February.

  As usual, the presentations will be followed by an open
  <span class="removed">trolling session</span> discussion.

Join us to chat over a drink and meet with the Ruby community of Sophia.
