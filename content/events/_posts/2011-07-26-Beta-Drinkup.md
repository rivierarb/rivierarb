title: Beta of the Ruby Drink-up of Sophia Antipolis
---

The first _Ruby drink-up of Sophia_ took place on the 26th of July at the 
Green King pub. We got twelve early adopters for this Beta and 
had a very good time.

Thanks to [Evangenieur](http://www.evangenieur.com/wordpress/) for a very
interesting demonstration of a social-video-sharing project he is 
working on with his team.
We also had a fruitful discussion on the next steps for the Ruby group and 
agreed on organizing a __regular drink-up, on the first Tuesday of each 
month, starting in September__.

We will schedule two mini-talks of less than 
15 minutes each, at the beginning of each drink-up and maintain the event 
even if there is no candidate for a mini-talk.
There is no registration needed to attend the drink-up and we are open 
to any subject for the mini-talks, so don't be shy!

At that time the action plan was to:

* Finalize the choice of a name for the event. We now have _"Ruby 
Drink-up Sophia"_.
* Setup communication channels: mini-blog, Twitter, Facebook, mailing list 
Rails France. The mini-blog is still in its infancy but, as you can see, it 
is up and running.
* Launch a contest on the design of a logo for Riviera.rb. More to 
come on this subject, stay tuned...

Thanks to the Green King's staff for the warm welcome, and let's meet again on
the __6th of September at 6:30pm__ for the real thing.
We will communicate the subjects of the two mini-talks by the end of 
August.
